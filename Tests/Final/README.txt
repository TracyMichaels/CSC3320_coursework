This folder is my submission for my final project

- C programs can be compiled with gcc
- makefile compiles question1.c

Contents:
Final_TracyMichaels.pdf - contains all answers to each prompt
question1.c 		- contains answer code for question 1 of exam, can accept command line arguments for file path
question2.sh 		- contains answer code for question 2 of exam
question3_examples.c 	- contains examples used in answering question 3
text.txt 		- file used for parts 1 and 2, it is a copy of the exam prompt in its entirety
demo.txt 		- this is the output file from  question3_examples.c, funnily enough, 
		 		the number of lines in this file indicates the number of successful 
				executions of question3_examples.c I had while testing each part of the 
				question. this file isn't necessary to run question3_examples.c as the 
				program will create one if it doesn't already exist
